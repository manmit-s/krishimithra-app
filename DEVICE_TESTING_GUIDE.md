# KrishiMithra - Real Device Testing Setup

## 🔧 **Fixed Network Connection Issue!**

### Problem Solved:
- ❌ **Before**: App tried to connect to `127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost)
- ✅ **After**: App now connects to `192.168.1.36:8000` (your computer's IP)
- ✅ **Server**: Now listening on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8000`)

### 📱 **Current Configuration:**

#### Flutter App:
```dart
// lib/services/api_service.dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.36:8000';
```

#### FastAPI Server:
```bash
uvicorn app_image_response:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### ✅ **Steps to Test on Real Device:**

1. **Ensure your device and computer are on the same WiFi network**
2. **Server is running** on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (✅ Currently running)
3. **Flutter app updated** to use `192.168.1.36:8000` (✅ Done)
4. **Test the connection:**
   - Open browser on your phone
   - Go to: `http://192.168.1.36:8000/health`
   - Should show: `{"status": "ok", "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"}`

### 🔥 **If Windows Firewall Blocks Connection:**

Run this command as Administrator in PowerShell:
```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="KrishiMithra API" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
```

Or manually:
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Click "Change Settings" then "Allow another app"
